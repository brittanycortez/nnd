	<p> The blocks on the stretch of Flushing Avenue along the Bushwick/Ridgewood border are populated by buildings with spray-paint coated facades, within them artisan marketplaces and real estate agencies. After its route surpasses Cypress Street however, the Vander-Ende Onderdonk house, New York’s oldest Dutch colonial home, offers an abrupt tone change. </p>

	<p> In its backyard, puzzled neighborhood residents peer into a chicken coop placed along a white picket fence, and vendors sell anything from furs traded in the 1600s to the traditional Dutch cider “mead.” Audible among the hum of live music is one, recurring remark: “Is this New York?” </p>

</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col m8 offset-m2">

	<p> It is New York, but is reflective of a New York where the tentative Brooklyn/Queens border was stringent enough that men would stone one another over its official marker. It’s New Amsterdam. </p>

	<p> For the second spring in a row, The Onderdonk House and The Greater Ridgewood Historical Society have maintained New York’s history by hosting to The New Amsterdam Festival, a free event which offers Dutch activities for Bushwick and Ridgewood residents of all ages. The tradition of The New Amsterdam Festival has just begun, but could very well serve as one of the last parcels of history in a neighborhood that is rapidly evolving. </p>

	<p> The white stone exterior of the Vander-Ende Onderdonk House is complemented by its olive green window shutters, with manicured shrubs and blooming tulips which seem unaware of the brisk temperatures mere weeks before. The house has stood since 1660, its name paying homage to the two families who resided within its walls the longest: the Vande-Ende’s for 90 years, and the Onderdonk’s for 100. Inside, Caitlin Mcdonough, a founding member of the Greater Ridgewood Historical Society, skims an antique map of the island of Brooklyn and Queens. </p>

	<p> Caitlin Mcdonough and her fellow members of The Greater Ridgewood Historical Society can be found at the Onderdonk House four days a week, offering guided tours for a suggested donation of $10 and selling Dutch knick knacks. For the New Amsterdam festival however, named after New York’s original Dutch settlement, residents of Bushwick and Ridgewood are able to wander freely around the house’s premises, as a musical group sporting 1600s garb performs. Children outside sit on the grass fashioning windmills, and other residents tumble down the land’s curvature as they play the Dutch sport “knockerball.” For the most part, however, the event is occupied by young adults adorned in neon outfits and face paint, dancing and hula-hooping throughout the property’s bounds. </p>

	<p> Although she acknowledges the preservation of the Wyckoff house in Canarsie, Mcdonough offers that the remaining Dutch houses in New York are few and far between. “Many of the houses are gone, and as far as I know, there aren’t any other organizations or initiatives in New York set up to specifically preserve New York’s Dutch history,” Mcdonough remarks. </p>

	<p> The residents of the neighborhood of Bushwick boast a median age of 30.2 years old, about 20% below that of the median age of that of New York as a whole. In 2016, Brooklyn’s Chamber of Commerce reported that that the borough’s population growth continued to be at a rapid continuum, and that the borough continues to welcome innovation through emerging businesses. New shops and restaurants surrounding the Onderdonk house make use of old buildings and warehouses, exchanging their histories for more profitable futures. </p>

	<p> Among this influx of youth and change however, The Vander-Ende Onderdonk house stands its historical ground, landing itself on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978, as well as obtaining New York landmark status in 1995. Although the New Amsterdam Festival is dominated by young faces, residents throughout many walks of life convene for the event, trying on relics of their neighborhood’s colonial beginnings, weaving together wreaths and trying on bonnets. Throughout its two year life, the New Amsterdam Festival has too offered a new element to its neighborhood, not by creating a novel business, but instead establishing a custom for years to come. </p>
